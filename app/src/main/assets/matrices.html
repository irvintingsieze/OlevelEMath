<p>In this topic, we are going to learn how to <br/>
    1. Identifying Matrices <br/>
    2. Addition and subtraction of Matrices<br/>
    3. Multiplication of Matrices<br/>



</p><p><strong>1. Identifying Matrices</strong><br/><br/>

    Matrices can be used to solve questions where data can be represented in a table form. <br/>

Eg Qsn1: 2 students John and Mary went to the bookstore to buy some stationary.
    John bought a pencil, 2erasers and 3 pens while Mary bought 4 pencils, 5 pens and 6 erasers. <br/><br/>
The following data can be represented in a table below. <br/>
    <style>
table {
    font-family: arial, sans-serif;
    border-collapse: collapse;
    width: 100%;
}

td, th {
    border: 1px solid #dddddd;
    text-align: left;
    padding: 8px;
}

tr:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: #dddddd;
}
</style>

    <h2>Table</h2>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Pencil</th>
            <th>Eraser</th>
            <th>Pen</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>John</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>3</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Mary</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>

    </table><br/>


The following table can also be represented in a matrix $(\table \1, \2, \3; \4, \6,\5 )$.<br/><br/>
The numbers from going from left to right are called rows. The first row is 1,2,3.<br/>
The numbers going from up to down are called columns. The first column is 1,4. <br/><br/>
The size of the matrix can be represented by (rows) x (columns). In this case, it is a 2 x 3 matrix.<br/><br/>

A row matrix is a matrix with only 1 row. Eg. ( 1 , 2 , 3 )<br/>
A column matrix is a matrix with only 1 column. Eg. $(\table \1, \2, \3)$ <br/>

</p><p><strong> 2. Addition and subtraction of Matrices</strong><br/><br/>
    Matrices can be added or subtracted ONLY if they are of the same size. <br/>
    A 3 x 3 matrix can only be added by another 3 x 3 matrix and so on.<br/><br/>

    To add the matrices, we just have to add the numbers of the matrices in the same position.<br/>
    Eg. $(\table \1, \2, \3; \4, \5,\6 )$ + $(\table \2, \3, \4; \5, \6,\7 )$ = $(\table \3, \5, \7; \9, \11,\13 )$ <br/><br/>
    The same goes for subtraction.
    Eg. $(\table \10, \9, \8; \7, \6,\5 )$ - $(\table \1, \2, \3; \4, \5,\6 )$ = $(\table \9, \7, \5; \3, \1,\-1 )$<br/><br/>


<p><strong> 3. Multiplication of Matrices</strong><br/><br/>
Matrix can be multiplied in 2 ways, by a number of by another matrix. <br/><br/>
To multiply a matrix by a number, one simply multiply the number to all of the values in the matrix. <br/>

Eg. If a = $(\table \1, \2, \3; \4, \5,\6 )$ , 3a = $(\table \3, \6, \9; \12, \15,\18 )$ <br/><br/>

To multiply matrices, the number of column of the 1st matrix MUST be equal to the number of rows in the 2nd matrix. <br/>
The resulting matrix will have the number of rows of the 1st matrix and the number of columns in the 2nd matrix <br/>
Eg. A 2 x 3 matrix can multiply a 3 x 2 matrix  but not a 2 x 3 matrix. <br/><br/>

To multiply matrices, one must find the add the product of all the rows with all columns.
    The 1st row must multiply all the column first before going on to the second row. <br/>

An example will be $(\table \1, \2, \3; \4, \5,\6 )$ x $(\table \1, \2; \3, \4; \5,\6 )$ = $(\table \22, \28; \49, \64)$<br/><br/>
 1 x 1 + 2 x 3 + 3 x 5 = 22<br/>
 1 x 2 + 2 x 4 + 3 x 6 = 28<br/>
 4 x 1 + 5 x 3 + 6 x 5 = 49<br/>
 4 x 2 + 5 x 4 + 6 x 6 = 64<br/>
Thus the resulting matrix is  $(\table \22, \28; \49, \64)$. <br/><br/>
