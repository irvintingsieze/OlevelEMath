    <title>Arc Length, Area of Sector and Radian Measure</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>In this topic, we are going to learn how to <br/>
    1. Identify the parts of a circle.<br/>
    2. Convert between radian and degrees<br/>
    3. Calculate length and area of a sector. <br/>

</p><p><strong>1. Identify the parts of a circle</strong><br/><br/>

    <u>Arc</u> <br/>
    An arc is a part of a curve/ circle. From the image above, BC is an arc.<br/>
    <u>Sector</u> <br/>
    A sector is a part of a circle enclosed by two radius and the included arc. <br/>
    <u>Chord</u> <br/>
    A chord is a straight line in the circle that extends to 2 points of the circle.<br/>
    <u>Segment</u> <br/>
    A segment is a part of a circle enclosed by a chord and the included arc. <br/><br/>

Note: There is no need to memorise the definition. However, you MUST know how to identify the different parts of a circle.<br/>

</p><p><strong>2. Convert between radian and degrees</strong><br/><br/>
    <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/arc_learn.PNG" width="100%" /><br/>

    The above image will be used as a reference to describe the 3 learning objectives.<br/>
    A radian of a circle is the RATIO of the arc length to the radius.<br/>

    <center>$∠BAC$= $s/r$ radians</center><br/>

1 radian = ${180°}/π$ <br/>
1° = $π/{180°}$ <br/>

</p><p><strong>3. Calculate length and area of a sector</strong><br/><br/>

    With reference from the image above, <br/><br/>

    <u>Using degrees, </u><br/>
    Arc length of BC = ${∠BAC}/360° x 2πr $ <br/>
    Area of sector ABC = ${∠BAC}/360° x πr^2 $<br/>

    <u>Using radian,</u><br/>
    Arc length of BC = r$θ$  <br/>
    Area of sector ABC = $1/2r^2θ$<br/>
    Where θ is the ∠BAC in radians<br/>
