<p>In this topic, we are going to learn how to <br/>
    1. Recognise and draw graphs $Y=aX^n$ and $Y=ka^X$<br/>
    2. Find the gradient of a curve by drawing a tangent and solving graphical problems<br/>

</p><p><strong>1. Recognise the graphs $Y=aX^n$ and $Y=ka^X$</strong><br/><br/>

    Tip: If you forget the shape of the graph, just substitute x values and sketch the graphs!<br/>

<p><strong>2. Find the gradient of a curve by drawing a tangent and solving graphical problems</strong><br/><br/>
    Q1. A new vehicle on experiment is set to move from point A to B in a straight line, which it reaches after 3s. The speed, s (Km/h) and time (s) follows a function $s=-3^3+3$.<br/>
    (a) Draw a table to display the speed s where 0≤t≤3<br/>
    (b) Using the scale 1cm to represent 0.5s in the horizontal axis and 1cm to represent 5km/h in the vertical axis, draw the graph
    of s against t for 0≤t≤3<br/>
    (c) Using the graph, calculate the acceleration at t=2s<br/>
    (d) Using the graph, estimate the distance travelled when 2.5≤t≤3. Express your answer in metres<br/><br/>

(c) Acceleration is the rate at which velocity (speed) is changing. (Since the car is moving in a straight line, the velocity and speed is the same for this case<br/>
Therefore, finding acceleration of t=2 is finding the gradient at t=2.<br/>
To find the gradient at t=2, we draw a tangent. The space between the tangent and the curve should be equal before and after t=2s<br/>
<img src="file:///android_res/drawable/graphoffunctions_tangent.PNG" width="100%" /><br/>
Remember the gradient = = $\text"Difference in s value" / \text"Difference in t value"$<br/>
The difference in s value = 17-3 = 14Km/h<br/>
The difference in t value = 2.5-1.5=1s<br/>
However the time and speed unit is not uniform. We can change the unit of time to complement the speed.<br/>
1s = $1/60$min = $1/3600$h<br/>
The acceleration at t=2 is  14 x $1/3600$=50400Km/$h^2$  <br/><br/>

(d) Distance = speed X Time.<br/>
Therefore to find the distance travelled, we calculate the area under the graph at 2.5≤t≤3<br/>
The time difference = 0.5s = $1/7200$h<br/>
Area under the graph = Area of trapezium= ${19+30}/2$X $1/7200$h = 0.003402(4sf)Km = 3.40m (3sf)<br/>
Total distance traveled is 3.40m (3sf).
