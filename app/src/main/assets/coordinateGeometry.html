<p>In this topic, we are going to learn how to find <br/>
    1. Gradient of the graph<br/>
    2. Length of the Graph<br/>
    3. Equation of linear graph<br/>
    4. Equations of vertical and horizontal lines<br/>

    From this graph we can understand the first 3 learning objectives. <br/><br/>
    1. The gradient of the line, usually denoted as M, is ${Y2-Y1}/{X2-X1}$.<br/> An easier way of looking is Gradient = $\text"Difference in Y value" / \text"Difference in X value"$
    Note: The gradient of the line need not be taken from the start and end point of the line as illustrated. <br/><br/>
    2. The length of the line from point A to B is $âˆš{(X2-X1)^2+(Y2-Y1)^2}$ (This formula is derived from Pythagoras Theorem.)<br/><br/>
    3. The equation of the line is Y=MX+C, where M is the gradient and C is the Y intersect. In this case, M = ${Y2-Y1}/{X2-X1}$ and C = Y3. <br/>
    (Tip: To check if the equation is correct, substitute the X value and you will get the corresponding Y value, or vice versa,
    eg. if u sub in X1 value, you should get Y1 value) <br/><br/>

 4. The equation of the vertical line is X=a. The gradient is undefined.<br/>
The equation of the horizontal line is Y=b. The gradient is 0.<br/><br/>

Tips: Do not jam your brain all the formulas. Understand the concept.
    Example, you do not have to memorise the formula at point 2. Just remember to use pythagoras theorem and find the length.
Secondly, if you forgot the gradient of vertical line, just use the coordinates and calculate. You will realise $\text"Difference in Y value" / \text"0"$ is undefined.
