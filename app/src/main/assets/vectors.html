<p>In this topic, we are going to learn how to <br/>
    1. Representing Vectors<br/>
    2. Magnitude of a vector<br/>
    3. Addition and Subtraction of Vectors<br/>


</p><p><strong>1. Representing Vectors</strong><br/><br/>

    A vector shows the magnitude (distance) and direction between 2 points.  <br/>
    <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/vector1.PNG" width="100%" /><br/><br/>
    To represent the vector from point X to Y is ${XY}↖{→}$.
    The vector ${XY}↖{→}$ can also be defined as a variable eg. a with a curly line beneath. ${a}↙{~}$<br/><br/>
    As vectors involve direction, the vector $-{XY}↖{→}$ is conversely $-{a}↙{~}$.<br/>
    As vectors involve magnitude, a vector $k{XY}↖{→}$ can used to represent a line  of varying length <b>parallel</b> to ${XY}↖{→}$. <br/><br/>


Point X is also ${OX}↖{→}$, where the starting point is the origin, O.
Similarly, Point Y is ${OY}↖{→}$<br/>

<p><strong>2. Magnitude of a vector</strong><br/><br/>

    The magnitude of a vector can also be seen as the distance the vector covers. <br/>
    <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/vector2.PNG" width="100%" /><br/><br/>
    A vector can be written as a column matrix with 2 rows (2D vectors).<br/><br/>
    An example will be ${XY}↖{→}$= ${a}↙{~}$= $(\table \3; \4)$.<br/>
    The top row will represent the distance the vector covers horizontally.<br/>
    The bottom row will represent the distance the vector covers vertically <br/><br/>
    To calculate the magnitude of ${XY}↖{→}$ or ${a}↙{~}$ is by pythagoras theorem<br/><br/>
    Take the sum of the squares in the matrix and root the sum<br/>
    ${XY}↖{→}$ = $√{3^2 + 4^2}$ = 5.<br/><br/>
    If vectors cancels each other eg ${a}↙{~}$ - ${a}↙{~}$ , the product will be a zero vector ${0}↙{~}$<br/>
    ${a}↙{~}$ - ${a}↙{~}$ = ${0}↙{~}$ <br/>


</p><p><strong> 3. Addition and Subtraction of Vectors</strong><br/><br/>
   To add 2 vectors, the 2 letters closest to the " + " sign must be the same.  <br/>
    The resulting vector will consist of the two outer letters joined together. <br/>

    <br/>Eg. ${XY}↖{→}$ + ${YZ}↖{→}$ = ${XZ}↖{→}$ <br/><br/>
    <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/add_vector.PNG" width="100%" /><br/><br/>

    In the image above, we also can tell that
    if ${XY}↖{→}$ = ${a}↙{~}$, and ${YZ}↖{→}$ = ${b}↙{~}$, ${XZ}↖{→}$ = ${a}↙{~}$+ ${b}↙{~}$ <br/><br/>
    <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/add_vector1.PNG" width="100%" /><br/><br/>
    As vectors is not position specific, we can also say that ${XY}↖{→}$ = ${a}↙{~}$+ ${b}↙{~}$ <br/><br/>

    For subtraction, the first letter of both vectors must be the same. <br/>
    The 2nd letter of the the second vector and the 2nd letter of the first vector will be the resulting vector.<br/>
    Eg. ${YX}↖{→}$ - ${YZ}↖{→}$ = ${ZX}↖{→}$<br/>
    <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/vector_sub.PNG" width="100%" /><br/><br/><br/>

    As point X is ${OX}↖{→}$ and point Y is ${OY}↖{→}$, we can tell that ${XY}↖{→}$ is also ${OY}↖{→}$ - ${OX}↖{→}$<br/>
