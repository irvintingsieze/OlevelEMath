<p>In this topic, we are going to learn how to <br/>
    1. Find the angle of elevation and depression<br/>
    2. Calculate the bearing of a point. <br/>

</p><p><strong>1. Find the angle of elevation and depression</strong><br/><br/>

    <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/apptrigo_elevation_angle2.PNG" width="100%" /><br/>

    The angle of elevation from the guy to the top of the tree is as shown. <br/>
    His line of sight to the top of the tree forms a right angle triangle ABC as shown. <br/>
    To find the angle of elevation, use the basic trigonometry formula SOH CAH TOA with 2 known lengths.<br/>
    Recap: sinθ = $\text"opp" / \text"hyp"$<br/>
    cosθ = $\text"adj" / \text"hyp"$<br/>
    tanθ = $\text"opp" / \text"adj"$<br/><br/>
    Note that the angle of elevation from the guy to the top of the tree is the SAME as the angle of depression from the top of the tree to the guy!<br/>
    It is the same due to the use of alternate angle.<br/>

</p><p><strong>2. Calculate the bearing of a point.</strong><br/><br/>
    <img src="file:///android_res/drawable/apptrigo_bearings.PNG" width="100%" /><br/>

The bearing of A from O(origin) is calculated from the north of O, in a clockwise direction. <br/>
Bearings are always expressed as a 3 digit number (exclusive of decimals). <br/>
In this case, the bearing of A from O is 035°. <br/><br/>
Similarly, the bearing of O from A is calculated from the north of A, in a clockwise direction.<br/>
The bearing of O from A is 235°. There is no need to add a 0 in front as 235 is already a 3 digit number.<br/>
